                            <p> Western honey bees are the most common species of honey bee across the world. Western honey bees were imported to North America to pollinate agricultural crops and can be distinguished from native bees by their coloring, which is golden brown with black abdominal stripes. The honeybees you'll see are female workers. As the bees collect pollen, they move it across their bodies and to their legs where they place it in little baskets.</p>

                            <p>Western honey bees can sting but rarely do becuase it kills the bee.</p>

                            <p> Bumblebees are common in the US with 49 native species! They are slightly larger than honeybees and have a black body with dense yellow and black hair. Bumblebees can be confused with carpenter bees, but carpenter bees are much larger than bumblebees. Bumblebees got their name from the noise they make inside a flower! They move around so quickly that the sounds vibrations they create makes the pollen fall onto their body hairs.</p>

                            <p> Carpenter bees are also called wood bees and are not well liked. The female workers of these bees bore into wood and make perfectly circular holes. The holes are the female carpenter bees reproductive nest. In the spring, new carpenter bees will leave the nest hole in single file. Carpenter bees are often viewed as destructive and it can be hard to stop them unless wood is painted or sealed. They can be destructive in the plant world too: on small flowers where they can't fit inside like blueberries, they chew into them. This doesn't pollinate the flower at all but just lets the carpenter bee steal the nectar. </p>

                            <p>Mason bees are small, fast-flying bees that are extremely agile and are metallic blue, dull green and black. These bees carry pollen in hairs on the underside of their abdomens instead of in little baskets on their legs. Mason bees get their name from their use of mud to close their nest cavities.In nature, they look for a hollowed-out stem or a twig. Mason bees also readily use bee hotels created by humans that have holes already drilled in for them.</p>

                            <p>Leafcutter bees are very similar to mason bees in their nest creating habits, except they use leaves to close up their nests. They are black with white hairs covering the thorax and the bottom of the abdomen. Many leafcutter bee species have large heads with massive jaws to help with cutting off pieces of leaves to seal their nests. Also similar to mason bees, leafcutter bees carry pollen on their body hairs and are very fast flyers.</p>

                            <p>Yes they can sting but are not aggressive and thus rarely do. Leafcutter bees stings are supposed to be a lot less painful than honey bee stings despite their more menacing appearance.</p>

                            <p>Blueberry bees are around the same size of a honeybee but their hair patterns and banding make them look like a smaller version of a bumblebee or a carpenter bee.

These bees are unique in that they are one of the only bees that fly before sunrise and also around dusk when squash flowers usually open. Male squash bees nest and mate in squash flowers, while female squash bees nest in the ground near squash plants.</p>

                            <p> The sweat bee got its name because they are attracted to human sweat. These bees are small, some being only a quarter of the size of a honeybee. Since they are so small they are attracted to small flowers and are often active even until November.
